This is a solution to the [Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Javascript
- CSS/SCSS
- Flexbox

I mixed in traditional layouts with flexbox in order to practice how they work. The SCSS could be prettier and more logical, but I used this project mainly as an introduction to SCSS.
